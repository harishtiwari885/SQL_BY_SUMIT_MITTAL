The error happens because your SELECT statement includes age but you're grouping only by city.
In SQL, when you use GROUP BY city, every column in your SELECT list must either:
Be included in the GROUP BY clause (here, city), OR
Be inside an aggregate function (like COUNT(), SUM(), MAX(), MIN(), AVG()).
================================================================================================
 SQL GROUP BY Summary:
🔸 Rule 1:
Jo column tum SELECT mein likhte ho, wo ya toh:
GROUP BY clause mein hona chahiye
OR
Kisi aggregate function (jaise COUNT(), MIN(), MAX(), AVG(), SUM()) ke andar hona chahiye
🔸 Rule 2:
Agar column na GROUP BY mein hai, na aggregate function mein hai →
⛔️ SQL will throw an error (confused ho jaata hai ki kaunsi value dikhaye group ke liye).
✅ Examples:
✔️ Valid:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT city, COUNT(age) FROM gg GROUP BY city;
✔️ city — grouping column
✔️ COUNT(age) — aggregate function
❌ Invalid:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT age, COUNT(age) FROM gg GROUP BY city;
⛔️ age — not in GROUP BY, not in aggregate → Error
✔️ Fix:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT city, age, COUNT(*) FROM gg GROUP BY city, age;
✔️ city and age both in GROUP BY — no confusion
✔️ Aggregation done safely
🧠 Mindset:
SQL pehle group banata hai (GROUP BY clause ke basis pe)
Fir har group par aggregate functions apply hoti hain
Agar tum SELECT mein koi column doge jo group ke andar multiple values rakh sakta hai, toh:
SQL confused ho jaata hai: "Kaunsa dikhau?"
Bhai tu full samajh gaya. Agar chaahe toh main ab kuch practice questions ya real-world examples bhi kara sakta hoon! 😎🔥
